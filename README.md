## Why you need a Random Password Generator

Passwords are a real security threat. Over 80% of hacking-related breaches are due to weak or stolen passwords, a recent report shows . So if you want to safeguard your personal info and assets, creating secure passwords is a big first step. Impossible-to-crack passwords are complex with multiple types of characters (numbers, letters, and symbols). Making your passwords different for each website or app also helps defend against hacking. 

### The best password tips from the pros

1. Always use a unique password for each account you create. The danger with reusing passwords is that as soon as one site has a security issue, it‘s very easy for hackers to try the same username and password combination on other websites.
2. Don’t use any personally identifiable information in your passwords. Names, birthdays, and street addresses may be easy to remember but they’re also easily found online and should always be avoided in passwords to ensure the greatest strength.
3. Make sure your passwords are at least 8 characters long and contain letters, numbers, and special characters. Some people prefer to generate passwords which are 14 or 16 characters in length.

## Why you need a Password Vault

1. Passwords are remembered for you. A password-protected vault of passwords simplifies access to websites that require logins. Memorizing one master password is easier than memorizing a few passwords or, worse yet, dozens of passwords. According to the Google survey, 36% of people surveyed said they keep track of their passwords by writing them on a piece of paper.
2. Passwords can be unique and complex. If your password manager automatically generates a hard-to-guess password for each site you visit, it can prevent you from repeatedly using simple-to-guess passwords. The most commonly used passwords are easy to figure out: 123456, Password and abc123. A secure password, however, will feature at least 8 random characters, including numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and symbols.

## Why you need to Login to vault

1. As mutch care given to generate password that much care is given to storing the passwords. So we store password are encrypted. 
2. Password managers protect the data they store through what's known as encryption. This process scrambles data so that it's tougher for hackers, cybercrooks and others to access your personal information, such as Social Security numbers and credit card numbers. Compared with storing your passwords on a piece of paper in your desk or in a digital file stored on your laptop, encryption with a password manager is akin to locking passwords up in a bank vault.
3. If you’re creating a master password that you’ll need to remember, try using phrases or lyrics from your favorite movie or song. Just add random characters, but don't replace them in easy patterns.
4. Avoid weak, commonly used passwords like asd123, password1, or Temp!. Some examples of a strong password include: S&2x4S12nLS1*, JANa@sx3l2&s$, 49915w5$oYmH.
5. Avoid using personal information for your security questions, instead, use LastPass to generate another “password" and store it as the answer to these questions. The reason? Some of this information, like the name of the street you grew up on or your mother’s maiden name, is easily found by hackers and can be used in a brute-force attack to gain access to your accounts.
6. Avoid using similar passwords that change only a single word or character. This practice weakens your account security across multiple sites.
7. Change your passwords when you have reason to , such as after you've shared them with someone, after a website has had a breach, or if it's been over a few months since you last rotated it.
8. You should never share your passwords via email or text message.
9. Encrypted password can only be decrypted if the encryption is done in a perticular manner (Using a Key). 
10. We use the master password to generate key which is used to encrypt and decript password.
